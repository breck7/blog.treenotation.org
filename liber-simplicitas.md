## DRAFT.

The Tree Notation system of writing consists of _cells_ and _symbols_ and _grids_ and _trees_ and _treeMachines_ and _programs_ and _grammars_.

A cell contains a symbol. A symbol can have many forms, but can always be reduced to a simple number.

The cell has a finite number of symbols it could contain. A cell can only contain one symbol at a time.

A dot could be a symbol, or a number, or even a long word. The word "word" is sometimes used interchangeably for symbol.

Tree Notation is recursive. You can expand domain of a cell by merging cells into a bigger cell.

The most basic cell is the binary cell. It can contain or not contain 1 bit of information.

By building bigger cells, you can define new symbols.

Cells are laid out on a grid. A grid has a height and a width.

Cells can be combined horizontally and/or vertically.

A Tree consists of cells linked together and/or a grid.

A TreeMachine is a physical system that can hold the contents of the Tree. A grid of transistors or lightbulbs or a piece of papyrus are all valid TreeMachines. A machine may or may not have computing abilities.

A program is the symbol values of the tree in the Machine.

A Machine has physical limitations on the programs it can contain. If a program cannot physically be represented on some Machine it is not a valid program for that machine.

Grammars can put further artificial restrictions on what programs are invalid, even if it were a valid program on a machine.

Using just these rules of notation, or syntax, all languages, from the simplest to the most complex, can be built in a straightforward manner.
